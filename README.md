## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* Node.js (v18+)
* MongoDB connection URI
* Groq API Key

### 1. Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>

### 2. Backend Setup
cd backend
npm install

Create a .env file and add your credentials:
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_key
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key

npm run dev

### 3. Frontend Setup
Open a new terminal window:
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev

### 4. Visit the Application
Navigate to `http://localhost:5173` in your browser. Register a new account to access the dashboard!

## 🔮 Future Scope

While the application is fully functional, here are some planned future enhancements:
1. **Real-time Collaboration**: Allow multiple users to connect to the same editor instance via WebSockets and run joint AI analyses.
2. **GitHub Integration**: Connect directly to your GitHub repositories to analyze whole pull requests rather than isolated snippets.
3. **Multi-File Context**: Allow users to upload multiple files or entire folder structures to give the AI context of the entire architecture.
4. **Export to PDF**: Generate a professional PDF report of the code analysis for documentation purposes.
